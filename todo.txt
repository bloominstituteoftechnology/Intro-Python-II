// DONE Put the Room class in `room.py` based on what you see in `adv.py`.

// DONE Put the Player class in `player.py`.

// DONE Create a file called `item.py` and add an `Item` class in there.

  // DONE This will be the _base class_ for specialized item types to be declared
    later.

  // DONE The item should have `name` and `description` attributes.

     // DONE Hint: the name should be one word for ease in parsing later.

// DONE Add the ability to add items to rooms.

  // DONE The `Room` class should be extended with a `list` that holds the `Item`s
    that are currently in that room.

  // DONE Add functionality to the main loop that prints out all the items that are
    visible to the player when they are in that room.

// DONE Add capability to add `Item`s to the player's inventory. The inventory can
  also be a `list` of items "in" the player, similar to how `Item`s can be in a
  `Room`.

// TODO Add a new type of sentence the parser can understand: two words.

  // TODO Until now, the parser could just understand one sentence form:

     `verb`

    such as "n" or "q".

  // TODO But now we want to add the form:

    `verb` `object`

    such as "take coins" or "drop sword".

  // TODO Split the entered command and see if it has 1 or 2 words in it to determine
    if it's the first or second form.

// TODO Implement support for the verb `get` followed by an `Item` name. This will be
  used to pick up `Item`s.

  // TODO If the user enters `get` or `take` followed by an `Item` name, look at the
    contents of the current `Room` to see if the item is there.

     // TODO If it is there, remove it from the `Room` contents, and add it to the
       `Player` contents.

     // TODO If it's not there, print an error message telling the user so.

     // TODO Add an `on_take` method to `Item`. 

        // TODO Call this method when the `Item` is picked up by the player.

        // TODO The `Item` can use this to run additional code when it is picked up.

     // TODO Add an `on_drop` method to `Item`. Implement it similar to `on_take`.

// TODO Implement support for the verb `drop` followed by an `Item` name. This is the
  opposite of `get`/`take`.

// TODO Add the `i` and `inventory` commands that both show a list of items currently
  carried by the player.
