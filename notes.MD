Inheritance vs composition:

d2 folder has thursdays work, cleaned it up


use __str__ to return it instead of it saying "object"


super().__init__(name, etc...) - inherits the previous self.name, self.whatever from the parent class but dont need to put self in the super one


composition = has_a
- as in composition has a "object" in it
- has many also

inheritance = is_a
- as in inheritance is a "object" and inherits from the parent


room is composition
and the stuff player accumulates is also composition
