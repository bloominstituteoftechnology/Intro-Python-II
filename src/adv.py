MVP 1 done

MVP 2 
Make rooms able to hold multiple items : DONE
Make the player able to carry multiple items : DONE
Add items to the game that the user can carry around : DONE
Add get [ITEM_NAME] and drop [ITEM_NAME] commands to the parser
MORE ON THIS:
Add a new type of sentence the parser can understand: two words.

Until now, the parser could just understand one sentence form:

verb

such as "n" or "q".

But now we want to add the form:

verb object

such as "take coins" or "drop sword".

Split the entered command and see if it has 1 or 2 words in it to determine if it's the first or second form.

? x = input("Enter comma-separated numbers: ").split(',')
* EG if it is north, the lenght of returned list should be 1, else two

Implement support for the verb get followed by an Item name. This will be used to pick up Items.

If the user enters get or take followed by an Item name, look at the contents of the current Room to see if the item is there.

If it is there, remove it from the Room contents, and add it to the Player contents.

If it's not there, print an error message telling the user so.

Add an on_take method to Item.

Call this method when the Item is picked up by the player.

on_take should print out "You have picked up [NAME]" when you pick up an item.

The Item can use this to run additional code when it is picked up.

Add an on_drop method to Item. Implement it similar to on_take.

Implement support for the verb drop followed by an Item name. This is the opposite of get/take.

Add the i and inventory commands that both show a list of items currently carried by the player.

#  Add a REPL parser to `adv.py` that accepts directional commands to move the player
#   * After each move, the REPL should print the name and description of the player's current room
#   * Valid commands are `n`, `s`, `e` and `w` which move the player North, South, East or West
#   * The parser should print an error if the player tries to move where there is no room.
